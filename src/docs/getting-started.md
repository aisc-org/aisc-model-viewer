# Welcome to the contributor's documentation!

This site is built to grow. We especially encourage:

Check out the tutorials for more information. Once you've developed your

with your submission. Or, if you know how to use git,
[fork the repository](https://github.com/otaithleigh/aisc-model-viewer) and make
a pull request with your added content.


This site is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and built
using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) from the sources hosted at our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/otaithleigh/aisc-model-viewer). You can
[set up a development environment](./#Setting-up-a-development-environment) to
build the site on your own machine, but this is not necessary to contribute.
