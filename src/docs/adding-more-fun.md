Adding a more fun item
======================

The "more fun!" pages on this site are collections of trivia and questions meant
to go one step further than your typical introductory steel design course. If
you have something you'd like to add, you can either
[open an issue](https://github.com/otaithleigh/aisc-model-viewer/issues/new/choose)
at the GitHub repository [or e-mail somebody? the maintainer?].

The more fun pages are written in Markdown, specifically
[Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).
