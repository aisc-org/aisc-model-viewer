Exporting to glTF
=================

Models for this site must be in [glTF format](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/).
You can preview your exported models using Don McCurdy's
[glTF viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/).


Blender
-------

Blender natively supports exporting to glTF.


SketchUp
--------

There are two plugins available for SketchUp:

- [glTF Export](https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/052071e5-6c19-4f02-a7e8-fcfcc28a2fd8/gltf-exporter)
  -- free, but no longer supported or updated; limited control over export
- [SimLab GLTF Exporter](https://www.simlab-soft.com/3d-plugins/Sketchup_GLTF_Exporter.aspx)
  -- costs money, gives more control over the export
