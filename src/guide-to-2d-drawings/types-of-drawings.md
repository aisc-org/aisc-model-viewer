Types of Structural Drawings
============================


Drawings are the primary way structural engineers communicate their designs. Together with architectural, electrical, and mechanical design drawings, as appropriate, structural design drawings define the work that is to be performed on a project. For structural steel buildings and bridges, the fabricator uses the design drawings produced by the engineer to produce shop drawings, which define each individual structural steel piece that is to be produced, and erection drawings, which define where the pieces are placed in the field. Structural design drawings generally include plans, elevations, sections, details, schedules, and notes.


Notes
-----
Notes are text and can appear throughout a drawing set. When placed at the front of a set and titled GENERAL NOTES, the information is applicable to all sheets and all disciplines. GENERAL STRUCTURAL NOTES, or just STRUCTURAL NOTES, apply to all sheets of the structural drawings. Information on these drawings include the code to which the structure was designed, key design criteria (e.g., live loads, wind speed, seismic design category), and typical material specifications. For example, structural notes may include a statement that W-SHAPES SHALL CONFORM TO ASTM A992, GRADE 50 UNLESS NOTED OTHERWISE. The term “unless noted otherwise”, sometimes abbreviated U.N.O., allows flexibility should a specific wide-flange member need to be of a different grade. 


Plans
-----
Plans show a view from above. For buildings, there is typically a plan for the foundation, each floor, and the roof. Information on plans includes location of columns, the layout and size of floor framing members, and floor elevations. 


Elevations
----------
Elevations show a view from the front or the side. They can be used to communicate the design of braced frames or other vertically oriented portions of a structure.   


Sections
--------
Sections show a view of the structure as if it has been cut along an imaginary plane. They are used to communicate information that cannot be easily seen in plans or elevations. Each section is referenced from another drawing. The drawing where the section is referenced must indicate the cutting plane and viewing direction. 


Details
-------
Details show portions of the structure in more detail than is possible in a plan, elevation, or section. The view of the detail is the same as that of the drawing from which it is referenced. Some details are listed as typical, which means they apply in more than one location. When developing typical details, it is important to ensure that they are general enough to apply in each location while still communicating the design information.


Schedules
---------
Schedules show information in tabular format. They are helpful for efficiently communicating the details of components of a structure that are repetitive and fit a pattern but are not identical.
