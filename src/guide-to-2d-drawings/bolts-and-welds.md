Displaying Bolts and Welds
==========================

Bolts
-------------
Bolts are complex three-dimensional objects with many features. They can be depicted in structural drawings with varying levels of detail, ranging from a simple line indicating the center of the bolt to a realistic depiction including each facet of the bolt, nut, and washer. Regardless of how detailed they are shown in the drawings, the important information regarding the bolts (e.g., quantity, diameter, grade) is typically called out in text. 


Welds
-----
The physical extent of welds is typically not shown in structural drawings. Instead, standard weld symbols are used to communicate the size, type, and length of weld along with other pertinent information. A guide to weld symbols can be found in Table 8-2 of the AISC *Manual*. The figures below describe key aspects of weld symbols for fillet welds.
