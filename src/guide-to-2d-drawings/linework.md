Linework
========

Different types of lines are used in structural drawings to represent different things. Common line types include:

* **Visible object lines** are solid and define the outline of a physical object.
* **Hidden object lines** are dashed and define a physical object or surface that is not visible in the current view.
* **Centerlines** have alternating long and short dashes and define the center of an object.
* **Break lines** have a zig-zag in the middle and are used to stop drawing an object when showing it in its entirety is not necessary. 
<!--- * **Cylindrical break lines** serve the same function as break lines but are used for round objects such as pipe. -->
* **Section cuts** show where an object is sliced and viewing orientation to create a section view. 
* **Extension and dimension lines** are used to indicate dimensions on a drawing. 
* **Leader lines** have an arrow at one end and a note at the other and are used to call out information.

Several of these types of lines are illustrated in the figures below.
