What would be the controlling limit state if the tension member was a WT6x25?

WTs are made by cutting a wide flange section lengthwise, either in a dedicated shop
or at the jobsite itself.
They are rarely, if ever, hot-rolled as separate sections.
The cut can be achieved in a variety of ways.
Due to residual stresses in the W section, the two pieces will actually bend
and may need to be straightened:

The block shear pattern with [tension in the flange and shear in the stem](#Block-shear-1)
is a bit out of the ordinary. The AISC *Engineering Journal* published papers that discuss
this sort of failure in [1996](https://www.aisc.org/Block-Shear-of-Structural-Tees-in-Tension-Alternate-Paths)
and [2002](https://www.aisc.org/Block-Shear-Net-Section-Capacities-of-Struct-Tees-in-Tension-Test-Results-Code-Implications).

There are a lot of limit states even for this one connection.
If you are unsure which controls, or if you are writing a design spreadsheet, it is a good idea to check them all.
With experience, you will gain a feel for which limit states control a given connection and simplify your calculations.
