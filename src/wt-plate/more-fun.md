There are a lot of limit states even for this one connection.
If you are unsure which controls, or if you are writing a design spreadsheet, it is a good idea to check them all.
With experience, you will gain a feel for which states control and limit your calculations.

WTs are made by cutting a wide flange section lengthwise, either in a dedicated shop
or at the jobsite itself.
They are rarely, if ever, hot-rolled as separate sections.
The cut can be achieved in a variety of ways.
Due to residual stresses in the W section, the two pieces will actually bend
and may need to be straightened:
