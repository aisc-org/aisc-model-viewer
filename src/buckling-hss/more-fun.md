HSS shapes are manufactured through a cold-forming process. Some producers have
[videos describing the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRQAJL3wJXA).
There are also opportunities to
[tour a production facility](https://www.aisc.org/steelday/questions/#32805) on
SteelDay.

How would the buckling modes be different if the HSS were rectangular and not
square?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are several advantages to filling an HSS with concrete to create a
composite column. One of the advantages is that the tube cannot locally buckle
inward. This does not prevent local buckling altogether, but does delay it and
helps to increase strength and ductility.
