One common application of double-angle compression members is as the top chord
of an open web steel joist. These members are subjected to combined axial
compression and bending moment, and can have slender elements. You can learn
more about open web steel joists from the
[Steel Joist Institute](https://steeljoist.org){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.

If the angles do not have equal leg lengths, then the double angle will be
either LLBB (long legs back-to-back) or SLBB (short legs back-to-back). Which of
these configurations is stronger for flexural buckling? Which is stronger for
flexural-torsional buckling?

End connection details are very important for built-up columns. You can watch a
discussion of this and other important stability concepts in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k30_FSEhXIE&t=3300s){target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}.
