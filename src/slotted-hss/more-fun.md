For this particular connection, fracture of the HSS controls the strength. But
in some applications, such as seismic design, you specifically want *yielding*
to control. This is because yielding of the structural members is relied on to
dissipate the energy of the earthquake. In order to prevent fracture from
controlling the strength of the connection, plates can be welded to the HSS
to increase the cross-sectional area at the point of the connection where the
slot has been cut for the plate:

This connection uses the [new A1085 standard](https://www.aisc.org/publications/steel-construction-manual-resources/#37587) for HSS.
