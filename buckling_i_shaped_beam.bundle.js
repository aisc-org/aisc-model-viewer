The girder is not subjected to axial compression, but the bending moment caused by the transverse loads generates longitudinal compressive stress in the top half of the girder. These stresses make the girder susceptible to lateral-torsional buckling, flange local buckling, and web local buckling.</p> <p>Lateral-torsional buckling is a type of buckling for a flexural member (e.g., beam or girder) involving deflection out of the plane of bending occurring simultaneously with twist about the shear center of the cross section.</p> <p>The critical load for flexural buckling of a basic column, <span class="math display">\\[P=\\frac{\\pi^2EI}{L^2},\\]</span> can be derived from differential equations. The critical moment for lateral-torsional buckling of a basic beam that is simply supported and has a constant moment diagram can also be derived from differential equations:</p> <p><span class="math display">\\[M_{o,\\text{cr}} = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\sqrt{EI_yGJ} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\pi^2EC_w}{GJL^2}}\\]</span></p> <p>It is hard to obtain analytical solutions for cases without a constant moment diagram. The lateral-torsional buckling modification factor defined in AISC <em>Specification</em> Section F1, <span class="math inline">\\(C_b\\)</span>, is used to approximate the effect of different loading conditions and extrapolate the results obtained analytically for the case of uniform moment to a broader range of moment diagrams. Note that the equation for <span class="math inline">\\(M_{o,\\text{cr}}\\)</span> above is equal to AISC <em>Specification</em> Equation F2-4 times <span class="math inline">\\(S_x\\)</span> when the unbraced length <span class="math inline">\\(L_b=L\\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\\(C_b=1.0\\)</span>.</p> <p>For the unbraced plate girder (<a href="./#Lateral-torsional">model</a>), <span class="math inline">\\(L_b\\)</span> is the full span of the beam, and <span class="math inline">\\(C_b=1.14\\)</span> (see AISC <em>Manual</em> Table 3-1). Providing lateral bracing at the midspan (<a href="./#Lateral-torsional-(braced)">model</a>) changes the buckled shape and increases the buckling load by both halving <span class="math inline">\\(L_b\\)</span> and increasing <span class="math inline">\\(C_b\\)</span> to 1.30 for each of the two unbraced lengths.</p> <h2 id="local-buckling-models">Local Buckling Models</h2> <p>Web and flange local buckling can also affect the strength of an I-shaped beam. In design, the web and compression flange are classified as either “compact,” “noncompact,” or “slender” based on the limiting width-to-thickness ratios in AISC <em>Specification</em> Table B4.1b. Elements classified as compact will not locally buckle before the member reaches its plastic capacity. Therefore, local buckling of these elements does not affect the available flexural strength. Elements classified as noncompact or slender may affect the available flexural strength.</p> <p>The flange of this girder is quite stocky and would be classified as compact for any practical yield strength. This means that the load at which the elastic buckling mode shown in the <a href="./#Flange">model</a> is much higher than what it takes to yield the girder, and flange local buckling would not affect the available strength. Notice how flange local buckling only occurs in the compression flange (not the tension flange) and near midspan (where the moments are greatest). Note that the web was restrained in the flange local buckling model to illustrate the mode more clearly.</p> <p>The web of this girder is rather thin and would be classified as noncompact for most grades of steel. There is no calculated limit state for web local buckling of I-shaped flexural members in the AISC <em>Specification</em>. Instead, the slenderness of the web affects the calculations of the other limit states. The classification of the web also helps determine which section of AISC <em>Specification</em> Chapter F to use for computing the available strength. Notice how web local buckling (<a href="./#Web">model</a>) only occurs in the top half of the web where the stress is compressive. Also note the slight ripples in the flange. Buckling of the web imparts a twisting force on the flange causing these deformations.</p> <h2 id="shear-buckling-models">Shear Buckling Models</h2> <p>Shear forces also generate compressive stress (remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohr&#39;s_circle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mohr’s circle</a>). One of the principal stresses in the web of the plate girder is compressive. This stress, which acts at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the beam, can cause shear buckling.</p> <p>Transverse stiffeners are used to restrain shear buckling and increase the available shear strength of I-shaped members with thin webs. Stiffeners are also used to help transfer large point loads or reactions into the member while avoiding web local yielding or crippling. Stiffeners used for transferring large loads are called bearing stiffeners. Notice the differences in the buckling mode between the <a href="./#No-transverse-stiffeners">model with only bearing stiffeners</a> and the <a href="./#With-transverse-stiffeners">model with bearing stiffeners and transverse stiffeners</a>).</p> <p>It is important to note that shear buckling of the web is not the end of the story. The available strength computed per AISC <em>Specification</em> Section G2 is often greater than the buckling load. This paragraph from the Commentary on AISC <em>Specification</em> Section G2.2 describes it well (emphasis added):</p> <blockquote> <p>The panels of the web of a built-up member, bounded on the top and bottom by the flanges and on each side by transverse stiffeners, are capable of carrying loads far in excess of their web elastic buckling strength. Upon reaching the theoretical web elastic buckling strength, slight lateral web displacements will have developed. These deformations <strong>are of no structural significance</strong>, because other means are still present to provide further strength.</p> </blockquote> <p>Post-buckling capacity is a reality for several, but not all, types of buckling for structural steel members.</p> '}),new n.Xs({name:"More fun!",content:'<p>The tables in Part 1 of the AISC <em>Steel Construction Manual</em> provide the section properties you need to run calculations for rolled shapes.
