The angles are separated by 3/8 in.</p> <p>A double angle is a singly symmetric shape. It is symmetric about the y-axis, but not the x-axis. This means that a double angle is susceptible to <a href="./#Flexural-buckling">flexural buckling about the x-axis</a> and <a href="./#Flexural-torsional-buckling">flexural-torsional buckling</a>. Flexural-torsional buckling is a mode of buckling in which a compression member bends and twists simultaneously without change in cross-sectional shape. The reason for the twist is that the centroid and shear center are not aligned. Buckling “pushes” the member through the centroid, but the member resists that push through the shear center. The resulting force couple causes twist.</p> <figure> <img src="${new URL(n(8119),n.b)}" alt=""/><figcaption>Shear center of double angle, offset from centroid.</figcaption> </figure> <p>A double angle is also a built-up shape. Connectors are necessary to make the two shapes behave as one member. Typically, the two angles of a double-angle compression member are connected at the ends of the member and a few points along the length. A single angle acting alone would buckle around its minor axis, the z-axis. For an L4x4x1/4, the radius of gyration about the minor axis is <span class="math inline">\\(r_z=0.783~{\\rm in.}\\)</span> and the radii of gyration about the geometric axis are <span class="math inline">\\(r_x=r_y=1.25~{\\rm in.}\\)</span> For a 2L4x4x1/4, the radius of gyration about the x-axis is <span class="math inline">\\(r_x=1.25~{\\rm in.}\\)</span>, no different than for the single angle. For flexural buckling, the connectors force buckling about the x-axis, but the strength of the double angle is otherwise not greater than twice the strength of the single angle.</p> <p>For a 2L4x4x1/4 with 3/8 in. separation, the radius of gyration about the y-axis is <span class="math inline">\\(r_y=1.78~{\\rm in.}\\)</span>, greater than that for a single angle. The increased radius of gyration increases the flexural-torsional buckling strength and is an indicator that shear forces will develop in the connectors. For modes of buckling like this, the slenderness of the built-up shape needs to be modified to account for the imperfect connection between the two shapes if the connector spacing is large or if the connectors allow slip (e.g., if the connectors are bolted snug-tight). This modification is described in AISC <em>Specification</em> Section E6.1.</p> <p>In an extreme case, if the distance between the connectors becomes very large, it is possible for one of the single angles to buckle on its own between the connectors before the double angle buckles as a whole (<a href="./#Single-angle-buckling">model</a>).</p> <p><a href="./#Local-buckling">Local buckling of the legs</a> can also occur in double-angle compression members with slender elements. In the model, out-of-plane moment of the back-to-back legs was restrained to better distinguish local buckling from torsional buckling.</p> `;new a.qw({title:"Buckling of Double Angle",groups:[{name:"models",items:[new a.Kx({name:"Flexural buckling",path:o}),new a.Kx({name:"Flexural-torsional buckling",path:r,maxScale:12}),new a.Kx({name:"Local buckling",path:i,maxScale:2}),new a.Kx({name:"Single-angle buckling",path:s})]},{name:"more",items:[new a.Xs({name:"Commentary",content:l}),new a.Xs({name:"More fun!",content:'<p>One common application of double-angle compression members is as the top chord of an open web steel joist.
